How arbitrage keeps PUSD price-stable

PUSD can always be minted and redeemed from the system for \$1 of value. This allows arbitragers to balance the demand and supply of PUSD in the open market. If the market price of PUSD is above the price target of \$1, then there is an arbitrage opportunity to mint PUSD tokens by placing \$1 of value into the system per PUSD and sell the minted PUSD for over \$1 in the open market. At all times in order to mint new PUSD a user must place \$1 worth of value into the system. The difference is simply what proportion of collateral and PEGS makes up that \$1 of value. When PUSD is in the 100% collateral phase, 100% of the value that is put into the system to mint PUSD is collateral. As the protocol moves into the fractional phase, part of the value that enters into the system during minting becomes PEGS (which is then burned from circulation). For example, in a 98% collateral ratio, every PUSD minted requires \$0.98 of collateral and burning \$0.02 of PEGS. In a 97% collateral ratio, every PUSD minted requires \$0.97 of collateral and burning $0.03 of PEGS, and so on.

If the market price of PUSD is below the price range of \$1, then there is an arbitrage opportunity to redeem PUSD tokens by purchasing cheaply on the open market and redeeming PUSD for \$1 of value from the system. At all times, a user is able to redeem PUSD for \$1 worth of value from the system. The difference is simply what proportion of the collateral and PEGS is returned to the redeemer. When PUSD is in the 100% collateral phase, 100% of the value returned from redeeming PUSD is collateral. As the protocol moves into the fractional phase, part of the value that leaves the system during redemption becomes PEGS (which is minted to give to the redeeming user). For example, in a 98% collateral ratio, every PUSD can be redeemed for \$0.98 of collateral and \$0.02 of minted PEGS. In a 97% collateral ratio, every PUSD can be redeemed for \$0.97 of collateral and $0.03 of minted PEGS.

The PUSD redemption process is seamless, easy to understand, and economically sound. During the 100% phase, it is trivially simple. During the fractional-algorithmic phase, as PUSD is minted, PEGS is burned. As PUSD is redeemed, PEGS is minted. As long as there is demand for PUSD, redeeming it for collateral plus PEGS simply initiates minting of a similar amount of PUSD into circulation on the other end (which burns a similar amount of PEGS). Thus, the PEGS token’s value is determined by the demand for PUSD. The value that accrues to the PEGS market cap is the summation of the non-collateralized value of PUSD's market cap. This is the summation of all past and future shaded areas under the curve displayed as follows.

*The demand-supply curve illustrates how minting and redeeming PUSD keeps the price stabilized (q is quantity, p is price). At CD_0 the price of PUSD is p_0=\$1 at q_0. If there is more demand for PUSD, the curve shifts right to CD_1 and a new price, p_1, for the same quantity q_0. In order to recover the price to \$1, new PUSD must be minted until q_1 is reached and the p_0 price is recovered. Since market capitalization is calculated as price times quantity, the market cap of PUSD at q_0 is the blue square. The market cap of PUSD at q_1 is the sum of the areas of the blue square and green square. Notice that in this example the new market cap of PUSD would have been the same if the quantity did not increase because the increase in demand is simply reflected in the price, p_1. Given an increase in demand, market cap increases either through an increase in price or increase in quantity (at a stable price). This is clear because the red square and green square have the same area and thus would have added the same amount of value in market cap. Note: the semi-shaded portion in the green square denotes the total value of PEGS shares that would be burned if the new quantity of PUSD was generated at a hypothetical collateral ratio of 66%. This is important to visualize because PEGS market cap is intrinsically linked to demand for PUSD.

Lastly, it’s important to note that PUSD is an agnostic protocol. It makes no assumptions about what collateral ratio the market will settle on in the long-term. It could be the case that users simply do not have confidence in a stablecoin with 0% collateral that’s entirely algorithmic. The protocol does not make any assumptions about what that ratio is and instead keeps the ratio at what the market demands for pricing PUSD at \$1. It could be the case that the protocol only ever reaches, for example, a 60% collateral ratio and only 40% of the PUSD supply is algorithmically stabilized while over half of it is backed by collateral. The protocol only adjusts the collateral ratio as a result of demand for more PUSD and changes in PUSD price. When the price of PUSD falls below $1, the protocol recollateralizes and increases the ratio until confidence is restored and the price recovers. It will not decollateralize the ratio unless demand for PUSD increases again. It could even be possible that PUSD becomes entirely algorithmic but then recollateralizes to a substantial collateral ratio should market conditions demand. We believe this deterministic and reflexive protocol is the most elegant way to measure the market’s confidence in a non-backed stablecoin. Previous algorithmic stablecoin attempts had no collateral within the system on day 1 (and never used collateral in any way). Such previous attempts did not address the lack of market confidence in an algorithmic stablecoin on day 1. It should be noted that even USD, which PUSD is pegged to, was not a fiat currency until it had global prominence.

# **Collateral Ratio**

The protocol adjusts the collateral ratio during times of PUSD expansion and retraction. During times of expansion, the protocol decollateralizes (lowers the ratio) the system so that less collateral and more PEGS must be deposited to mint PUSD. This lowers the amount of collateral backing all PUSD. During times of retraction, the protocol recollateralizes (increases the ratio). This increases the ratio of collateral in the system as a proportion of PUSD supply, increasing market confidence in PUSD as its backing increases.

At genesis, the protocol adjusts the collateral ratio once every hour by a step of 0 .25%. When PUSD is at or above \$1, the function lowers the collateral ratio by one step per hour and when the price of PUSD is below \$1, the function increases the collateral ratio by one step per hour. This means that if PUSD price is at or over \$1 a majority of the time through some time frame, then the net movement of the collateral ratio is decreasing. If PUSD price is under $1 a majority of the time, then the collateral ratio is increasing toward 100% on average.

In a future protocol update, the price feeds for collateral can be deprecated and the minting process can be moved to an auction based system to limit reliance on price data and further decentralize the protocol. In such an update, the protocol would run with no price data required for any asset including PUSD and PEGS. Minting and redemptions would happen through open auction blocks where bidders post the highest/lowest ratio of collateral plus PEGS they are willing to mint/redeem PUSD for. This auction arrangement would lead to collateral price discovery from within the system itself and not require any price information via oracles. Another possible design instead of auctions could be using PID-controllers to provide arbitrage opportunities for minting and redeeming PUSD similar to how a Uniswap trading pair incentivizes pool assets to keep a constant ratio that converges to their open market target price.
