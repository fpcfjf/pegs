# Pegs cash: Mixed-Algorithmic Stablecoin 

A new category of decentralized stablecoin.

With the continues growth of cryptocurrency market and the increase of overall market value, the demand for stablecoins is growing drastically. Compared with high-volatility cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, stablecoins are more applicable in cross-border exchange scenarios.

USDT is already ranked third place in terms of the market value, while USDC, DAI, and BUSD are within the top 50. Different from traditional asset-collateralized stablecoins, a new kind of stablecoins-algorithmic stablecoins are undergoing further exploration, such as AMPL, ESD,BAC and FRAX.

We are obsessed with the ingenious design of stablecoins, among which FRAX is a protocol we admire and participated in its launch early on. However, we believe that the launch of FRAX is a huge violation of the spirit of cryptocurrency. Algorithmic stablecoins are extremely reliant on community consensus, but FRAX token distribution plan caused panic in the community. Today weâ€™d like to introduce Pegs.cash, a fair launch and a better design of Algorithmic stablecoins backed by real asset.

Pegs cash can peg the currency value of the real market, and firmly peg the real value in the volatile cryptocurrency market.
