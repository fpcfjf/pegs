# Liquidity Programs & Staking

Distributing PEGS tokens to farmers and incentivizing DeFi programs with novel rules.

FXS rewards will be claimable for users who deposit Uniswap LP tokens to incentivized pairs, which can be attained by adding liquidity to token pairs on Uniswap. No fundraising. The total amount of PEGS is 30,000,000, 80% (24,000,000) are produced through mining, and the output of the first year of mining is 12,000,000 and then halved every year thereafter. PEGS only supports two trading pairs for mining, PUSD (stablecoin)/USDC, PEGS /PUSD, each accounting for 50%. 

The maximum speed of PEGS is not related to the CR value, and farmers don't need to lock, and the LP pledge can be unlocked at any time.

The minting and redemption fee are set to 0.3%, 30% of the seigniorage tax and redemption tax will be used as the fund reserve of Buyback, and 70% will flow into the dividend pool in PUSD. Staking PEGS to the dividend pool can be used for dividends, and dividends are issued every day at 0:00 UTC.
